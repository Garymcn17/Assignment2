For the assignment brief we were asked to make a game.

I began by deciding what game I wanted to make. I choose to try and recreate one of my favourite games and gamemode from that game. So I tried to recreate Pacifism from Geometry Wars. The concept of this game in theory would be easy to recreate but in practice it turned out a lot harder. I simplified the game so I could create it in processing. Its a game based on surviving and using gates to kill the enemies without being able to shoot. I went for a retro game look in my design as I thought this would be most suitable for a basic game on processing. 

#Features

    This is retro loading screen with instructions to start the game.

    This is a retro end screen which shows score and allows user to exit.
- The Game
    You are a ship.. And you must dodge the enemies and survive the waves.

    Keeps track of users score. User gets 2 score per 5 seconds they're alive, 10 per gate they activate and 100 per enemy they kill.

    A new enemy spawns every 10 seconds from a new corner and after 40 seconds faster enemies begin spawning.
